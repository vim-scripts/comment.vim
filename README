This script contains two simple functions to comment and uncomment visually selected blocks of C and C++ code using "#ifdef 0...#endif".   If'd out sections are commented with the author's name and a timestamp.

The default mappings are .c to comment and .C to uncomment.

e.x.
#if 0 /* author Tue Mar 25 19:08:09 EST 2003 */
...
#endif /* author Tue Mar 25 19:08:09 EST 2003 */
